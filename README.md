🎓 Students Exams Scores Analysis

A data analysis project that explores students' exam performance, visualizes insights, and identifies patterns affecting their scores. The aim is to understand the factors influencing students' academic results and provide meaningful insights using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

📌 Project Overview

In this project, we analyze students' exam scores from a given dataset.
We perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to understand the relationship between different factors like gender, parental education, test preparation, and subject-wise scores.

This project is ideal for anyone learning data analytics, Python, or machine learning basics.

✨ Features

📊 Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis – Understand score distributions and trends.

📈 Visualizations – Bar charts, histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.

🧠 Insights Extraction – Identify factors impacting student performance.

🛠 Extensible Code – Easy to modify for additional datasets or machine learning integration.
